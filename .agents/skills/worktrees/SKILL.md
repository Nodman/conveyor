# Worktrees

Vendored from obra/superpowers `using-git-worktrees` (MIT), commit
d00f4ad4428e99db18619e077b99340fb7158f2f. The body below "Using Git
Worktrees" is verbatim upstream except two `<!-- conveyor edit -->` sites.
To update: re-fetch upstream, re-apply the marked edits.

## Conveyor declarations

Precedence: in conveyor-orchestrated runs (executing-tasks, auto, direct
fixes on board cards) this section overrides the copied body wherever they
conflict — including EVERY native-tool-preference statement (Step 1a, Step
1b's "only if no native tool" guard, Quick Reference, Common Mistakes, Red
Flags). The body's native-tool preference applies only to solo ad-hoc
isolation outside the lifecycle.

- Dir: `.worktrees/<branch>` at the repo root. One worktree per issue;
  branch cut from `origin/<default>` after `git fetch origin` (default via
  `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, strip `origin/`;
  fallback `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`).
- Orchestrated per-issue worktrees ALWAYS use the git path (Step 1b) —
  codex `--workdir`, fix-round reuse, and the merge step need one stable
  shared path. Never native tools for these.
- No consent question inside the lifecycle — isolation is mandated.
- The body's `cd "$path"` is for solo sessions. Conveyor agents address the
  worktree per command — `git -C <path>` or a subshell
  (docs/gotchas/worktrees.md: cwd leaks; two-writer sweeps).
- Lifecycle: reuse the worktree across fix rounds; one write-mode codex per
  worktree; once all gates pass, `git worktree remove` it BEFORE the merge
  (a branch checked out in a worktree can't be `--delete-branch`d).
- Baseline (Steps 2–3): use the repo's `running-tests` project skill when
  present; the body's autodetect is the fallback. Record deps + baseline
  result in the ledger. Red baseline → stop and report; never proceed
  silently.

# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Ensure work happens in an isolated workspace. Prefer your platform's native worktree tools. Fall back to manual git worktrees only when no native tool is available.

**Core principle:** Detect existing isolation first. Then use native tools. Then fall back to git. Never fight the harness.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Step 0: Detect Existing Isolation

**Before creating anything, check if you are already in an isolated workspace.**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**Submodule guard:** `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also true inside git submodules. Before concluding "already in a worktree," verify you are not in a submodule:

```bash
# If this returns a path, you're in a submodule, not a worktree — treat as normal repo
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

**If `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` (and not a submodule):** You are already in a linked worktree. Skip to Step 2 (Project Setup). Do NOT create another worktree.
<!-- conveyor edit --> Conveyor runs: reuse is keyed to BRANCH identity, linked worktrees only. Issue branch checked out in a linked worktree (`git worktree list --porcelain`, entries after the first/primary) → use it at its existing path (legacy `.claude/worktrees/` paths stay valid until they drain). Inside a DIFFERENT issue's worktree → resolve the main checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` and create/reuse the issue worktree from there — never nest, never hijack. Issue branch checked out in the PRIMARY checkout → blocking violation: stop, `**Unblock:**` comment + humanOnly; never write there, never auto-switch the user's checkout.

Report with branch state:
- On a branch: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` on branch `<name>`."
- Detached HEAD: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` (detached HEAD, externally managed). Branch creation needed at finish time."

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (or in a submodule):** You are in a normal repo checkout.

Has the user already indicated their worktree preference in your instructions? If not, ask for consent before creating a worktree:

> "Would you like me to set up an isolated worktree? It protects your current branch from changes."

Honor any existing declared preference without asking. If the user declines consent, work in place and skip to Step 2.

## Step 1: Create Isolated Workspace

**You have two mechanisms. Try them in this order.**

### 1a. Native Worktree Tools (preferred)
<!-- conveyor edit --> Skipped in conveyor lifecycle runs — see Conveyor declarations.

The user has asked for an isolated workspace (Step 0 consent). Do you already have a way to create a worktree? It might be a tool with a name like `EnterWorktree`, `WorktreeCreate`, a `/worktree` command, or a `--worktree` flag. If you do, use it and skip to Step 2.

Native tools handle directory placement, branch creation, and cleanup automatically. Using `git worktree add` when you have a native tool creates phantom state your harness can't see or manage.

Only proceed to Step 1b if you have no native worktree tool available.

### 1b. Git Worktree Fallback

**Only use this if Step 1a does not apply** — you have no native worktree tool available. Create a worktree manually using git.

#### Directory Selection

Follow this priority order. Explicit user preference always beats observed filesystem state.

1. **Check your instructions for a declared worktree directory preference.** If the user has already specified one, use it without asking.

2. **Check for an existing project-local worktree directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
   ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
   ```
   If found, use it. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

3. **If there is no other guidance available**, default to `.worktrees/` at the project root.

#### Safety Verification (project-local directories only)

**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:** Add to .gitignore, commit the change, then proceed.

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.

#### Create the Worktree

```bash
# Determine path based on chosen location
path="$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME"

git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

**Sandbox fallback:** If `git worktree add` fails with a permission error (sandbox denial), tell the user the sandbox blocked worktree creation and you're working in the current directory instead. Then run setup and baseline tests in place.

## Step 2: Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

## Step 3: Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure workspace starts clean:

```bash
# Use project-appropriate command
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### Report

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already in linked worktree | Skip creation (Step 0) |
| In a submodule | Treat as normal repo (Step 0 guard) |
| Native worktree tool available | Use it (Step 1a) |
| No native tool | Git worktree fallback (Step 1b) |
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instruction file, then default `.worktrees/` |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore + commit |
| Permission error on create | Sandbox fallback, work in place |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Mistakes

### Fighting the harness

- **Problem:** Using `git worktree add` when the platform already provides isolation
- **Fix:** Step 0 detects existing isolation. Step 1a defers to native tools.

### Skipping detection

- **Problem:** Creating a nested worktree inside an existing one
- **Fix:** Always run Step 0 before creating anything

### Skipping ignore verification

- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status
- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree

### Assuming directory location

- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions
- **Fix:** Follow priority: explicit instructions > existing project-local directory > default

### Proceeding with failing tests

- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Create a worktree when Step 0 detects existing isolation
- Use `git worktree add` when you have a native worktree tool (e.g., `EnterWorktree`). This is the #1 mistake — if you have it, use it.
- Skip Step 1a by jumping straight to Step 1b's git commands
- Create worktree without verifying it's ignored (project-local)
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking

**Always:**
- Run Step 0 detection first
- Prefer native tools over git fallback
- Follow directory priority: explicit instructions > existing project-local directory > default
- Verify directory is ignored for project-local
- Auto-detect and run project setup
- Verify clean test baseline
